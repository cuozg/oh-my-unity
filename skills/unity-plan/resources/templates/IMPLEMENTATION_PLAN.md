# Implementation Plan: [Feature Name]

## 1. Executive Summary
Brief overview of the feature, requirements, and the technical approach.

## 2. Project Base Investigation
- **Existing Systems**: [List systems involved, e.g., PlayerState, InventoryManager]
- **Foundational Files**: [List key scripts or prefabs to modify]
- **Technical Constraints**: [Known limitations or legacy debt]

## 3. High-Level Decomposition

| Number | Epic | Task | Description | Type | Cost | Note |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|
| 1.1 | [Epic 1] | [Task Name] | [Detailed description] | Logic | S | [Context] |
| 1.2 | [Epic 1] | [Task Name] | [Detailed description] | Data | M | [Context] |
| 2.1 | [Epic 2] | [Task Name] | [Detailed description] | UI | L | [Context] |

## 4. Total Estimated Costing
- **Total Duration**: [e.g., 3-5 Development Days]
- **Resource Requirement**: [e.g., 1 Lead Dev, 1 UI Artist]
- **Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/High]

## 5. Implementation Workflow
1. **Setup Phase**: Create base data structures and placeholders.
2. **Logic Phase**: Implement core engine/system functionality.
3. **UI/UX Phase**: Wire up visuals and user interactions.
4. **Validation Phase**: Run Edit/PlayMode tests and verify with user.
5. **Polishing/Optimization**: Final cleanup and performance checks.

## 6. Definition of Done
