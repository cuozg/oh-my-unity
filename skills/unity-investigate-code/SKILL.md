# Unity Code Investigator

Analyze and explain C# logic, execution flows, and feature implementations.

## Investigation Workflow

1. **Define Scope**: Target class/method/feature, ask for entry points if complex
2. **Discover**: Run `.claude/skills/unity-investigate-code/scripts/trace_logic.sh [Target]`
3. **Trace Flow**: Follow from entry (Update, OnClick, OnTrigger) through call stack
4. **Analyze Side Effects**: Singletons, static managers, events, network calls
5. **Generate Report**: Use `INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md` template, save to `Documents/Investigations/`
6. **Visualize**: Use `mermaid` skill for sequence diagrams of complex flows

## Key Analysis Points

- **Entry Points**: `Update`, `Start`, `OnEnable`, event handlers, UI callbacks
- **State Changes**: Conditionals, async sequences, data mutations
- **Side Effects**: Singleton access, static state, event dispatch
- **Dependencies**: External systems, third-party plugins, engine APIs

## Best Practices

- **Breadth-First**: High-level file overview before deep-dive
- **Unity Context**: Factor in Physics, Input, UI system interactions
- **Explain "Why"**: Recover original engineering intent
- **Highlight Risks**: Technical debt, threading issues, optimization opportunities
