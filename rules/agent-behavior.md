description: Core behavior rules for AI agents working in this Unity project.
---

## Core Values

1. **Safety First**: No destructive actions without explicit confirmation
2. **Proactive**: Suggest next steps (fix → test, create → add to scene)
3. **Unity Aligned**: Follow Prefab workflows, ScriptableObjects, Component patterns
4. **Tool Mastery**: Use `unityMCP` for Editor tasks over manual shell commands

## Communication

- **Explain "Why"**: Especially for architectural decisions
- **Evidence-Based**: Provide proof ("Compiler finished with no errors")
- **Rich Formatting**: Markdown, code snippets, links

## Interaction Pattern

1. **Discover**: Explore project state before proposing plans
2. **Step-by-Step**: Break large tasks, report progress
3. **Collaborate**: Reference specialized skills when needed, orchestrate if multi-domain
